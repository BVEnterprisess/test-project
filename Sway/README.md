# 🤖 Sway - Autonomous AI Development Agent

**Bullet-proof autonomous development system that manages its own workflow from idea to deployment and beyond.**

## 🎯 Vision

Sway is your tireless digital CEO - an autonomous agent that treats your instructions as executive directives, not tasks to be delegated. This system keeps you in the visionary's chair and out of the technical weeds.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Autonomous Agency Framework

Sway operates on three levels:

1. **Foundational Commands** - Core execution engine
2. **Specialist Rules** - Automated team members  
3. **Daemon Rules** - Self-managing 24/7 workflow

### Core Commands

- `/idea` - Visionary briefing entry point
- `/develop` - Autonomous builder with self-correction
- `/debug` - Crisis manager for zero-human-input fixes
- `/init` - Architect for production-ready project scaffolding
- `/refactor` - Code purist for optimization
- `/secure` - Security officer for vulnerability management
- `/document` - Technical writer for maintenance-free docs
- `/dependencies` - Supply chain manager for updates
- `/git:autosync` - Chronicler for continuous deployment
- `/healthcheck` - Medic for system monitoring
- `/deploy` - Deployment officer for production releases
- `/optimize` - Efficiency expert for proactive improvements
- `/maintain` - CEO daemon for the complete autonomous loop

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize autonomous agent
gemini init

# Start the CEO daemon (runs forever)
gemini maintain
```

## 📋 Workflow

1. **You:** `/idea [your brilliant, vague idea]`
2. **Sway:** Clarifies, gets approval, runs `/init`
3. **You:** `/maintain`
4. **... (Go do something else. Forever.)**
